The **ThingsBoard Edge** is an open source software solution from ThingsBoard designed specifically for edge computing. It is free for both personal and commercial use, and you can deploy it anywhere. 

<img src="./img/thingsboard-e-icon.png?raw=true" width="100" height="100">

The **ThingsBoard Edge** enables users to process and analyze data closer to the source, improving performance and reducing latency. At the same time **ThingsBoard Edge** seamlessly synchronizes with the ThingsBoard Cloud ([ThingsBoard Demo](https://demo.thingsboard.io/) or [ThingsBoard CE](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard)), tailored to meet your specific business needs.

The **ThingsBoard Edge** documentation is hosted on [thingsboard.io](https://thingsboard.io/docs/edge/).

## ThingsBoard Edge use-cases

- **Autonomous Vehicles**
<br>Edge computing makes it possible to collect, process and react to road events with almost no latency. Modern autonomous vehicles produces tons of data - between 5 TB and 20 TB a day. 4G or 5G will not able to provide that network throughput, but with ThingsBoard Edge you are able to filter data. Most of this data should be processed locally, and only subset of this data will be pushed to the cloud.

- **Smart Farming**
<br>Quickly react to failures of silo aeration systems on a remote site even if connectivity to the Cloud from on-field location is pure at the moment.

- **Smart Houses**
<br>Bringing the processing and analyzing data closer to the smart house provides the possibility to secure sensitive user information at the Edge. Additionally, it provides a good user experience because of the low latency of smart house solutions - user will get responses from end devices much faster, comparing to connecting Edge devices to the Cloud to make some decisions. 

- **Security Solutions**
<br>It's necessary to react to security violations and threats within seconds and Edge provides this possibility. You don't need to care about quality of your connectivity to Cloud - decision will be made by local Edge engine on a remote site in real-time. 

- **In-hospital Monitoring**
<br>To secure data privacy in healthcare devices processing of this data must be done on the Edge. Push to the Cloud only required pieces of readings from medical devices, while storing all other sensitive data on the Edge. 
Additional benefit from Edge processing in this use-case - react to critical medical cases as quickly as possible due to real time processing of data from Edge medical devices.

- **Predictive Maintenance**
<br>Brings processing and storage of Edge device readings closer to the equipment. Analyze tons of data locally and detect changes in the production lines before a failure occurs. Send to the Cloud only average readings from productions lines according to your business needs.

## ThingsBoard Edge features

Unlock the key benefits of **ThingsBoard Edge**:

 - **Local Deployment and Storage:** Store and process data from Edge devices locally when there is no active connection to the Cloud, and push updates to the Cloud once the connection is restored.

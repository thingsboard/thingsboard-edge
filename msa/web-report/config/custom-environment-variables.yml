  # This parameter determines whether to create a new page for each web report.
  # When set to 'true', each web report will open on a separate page, providing clear separation and convenient viewing of reports.
  #
  # Caution:
  # - If this parameter is enabled ('true'), data caching functionality will be disabled.
  #   This means that data for each report will be reloaded every time the report is opened,
  #   which may increase page load times and server load.
  # - When this parameter is disabled ('false'), all web reports will open on a single page,
  #   allowing caching to be used for improved performance and faster page loading.
